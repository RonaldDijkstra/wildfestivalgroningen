#             Lambic beers have a sense of place unlike any other beer style. Although the breweries are located in the same Pajottenland area, every brewery houses its own mix of native yeasts and bacteria, freely flowing through the air and falling down in the wort during its overnight exposure to the air in the coolship. In this tasting we're going to explore 4 different lambics and 4 different geuze blends.

#             First we'll taste 4 lambics side by side, to discover the different aromas, flavors and characteristics. Then we'll taste 4 geuze blends, made with the same lambics. Each geuze blend has 50% of one lambic, and equal proportions of the other lambics. Through this tasting we can discover how the different lambics develop together in the bottle. Every participant gets 8 glasses (7 cl each) so we can compare all the different beers throughout the tasting.
