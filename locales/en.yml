        More than twenty participants from Europe will ensure an unique line-up of brewers, winemakers and cider houses. It brings together the passion for local ingredients, spontaneous fermentation and aging in oak barrels.
        In addition of drinking and tasting, there is delicious food in the foodcourt with real wild, fermented products and food directly harvested from nature.
