description: "Deep, dark, eternal.  The Umbral Abyss devours all that pierce its watery veil.  Eons of crushed debris give testament to this ancient nightmare.   Emerging from the darkest ancestry of Black Oktober, the Abyss rages with oak, brandy, and coffee.  This giant ediface is a true Imperial Stout. "
