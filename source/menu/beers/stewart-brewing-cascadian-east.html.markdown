description: "Pine - Citrus - Stone Fruits - Faint Caramel  A carefully selected blend of hops from the Cascadia region in the West Coast of North America. Aromas of pine forest, candied orange peel, grapefruit and citrus. Resinous from the bottle, slightly sweeter and very session-able on cask.   Expect a big white head, tongue tingling bitterness and a crisp, dry finish."
