We are of course forced to adjust a few things for the organization of our festival due to the corona virus. Make sure you always read the latest version of these rules before visiting our festival.
<br>
<ol>
<li>You'll need to buy a festival ticket to be able to buy tickets for one of the side events</li>
<li>We will have to keep 1.5 meters distance. Therefore the festival will be smaller, with sessions with only 120 people maximum!</li>
<li>A maximum of 2 people can sit closer to each other, or more people from the same household</li>
<li>Wild Festival will be an all seated event: you will get a placed table for the session and everybody has to stay at their place</li>
<li>You can order by an app on your phone or from a waiter</li>
<li>We will bring your order to you</li>
<li>You can only pay by card during the festival</li>
<li>Glasses will be rinsed at the bar</li>
</ol>
