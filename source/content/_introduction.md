# Welcome to Wild Festival Groningen

During the weekend of November 19, 2021 we bring the worlds of beer, natural wine and cider together, combined with delicious food. Wild spontaneous fermentation is the central theme, but we also offer beer styles like IPAâ€™s, stouts and saisons. 

In addition to the four festival sessions on Friday and Saturday, various side events will take place in the days around the festival.

**A festival that you don't want to miss!**
