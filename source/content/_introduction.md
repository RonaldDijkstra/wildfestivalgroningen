# Welcome to Wild Festival Groningen

Wild Festival Groningen 2021 is the second edition of an unique beer, wine, cider and food festival in one.

During the weekend of August 13, 2021 we bring the worlds of wild beer, natural wine and cider together. Wild spontaneous fermentation is the central theme, combined with delicious food provided by nature.

In addition to the four festival sessions on Friday, August 13 and Saturday, August 14, various side events will take place in the days around the festival.

Due to COVID-19 regulations we have chosen for a different format than last year's event, namely an all seater event. Please make sure you read our [COVID guidelines](/covid-guidelines/) before purchasing your ticket!

**A festival that you don't want to miss!**
