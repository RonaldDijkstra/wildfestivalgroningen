# Welcome to Wild Festival Groningen

Wild Festival Groningen 2021 is the third edition of an unique beer, wine, cider and food festival in one.

During the weekend of November 19, 2021 we bring the worlds of wild beer, natural wine and cider together. Wild spontaneous fermentation is the central theme, combined with delicious food provided by nature.

In addition to the four festival sessions on Friday and Saturday, various side events will take place in the days around the festival.

**A festival that you don't want to miss!**
