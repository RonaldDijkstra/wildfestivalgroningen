A ticket gives access to one session at the festival, a beautiful tasting glass and two tokens for € 2.

## What does a token cost?

Tokens cost € 2 each and can be broken into halves. The price can vary per beer, cider and wine.

## How long does a session last?

A session lasts four hours. Session 1 is from 1:30 PM to 5:30 PM. Session 2 is from 6:30 pm to 10:30 pm
The Wild Foodcourt is open from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. Here you can go during and after the first session, and if you come both sessions you can continue to eat, or you come before or during the second session to eat a delicious bite!

## When will the side events be announced?

In the coming period we will announce which side events will take place when and where. Expect very cool events. A number of "ticketed events" will take place for which you can purchase tickets separately.

## Are the same beers served during both sessions?

There will probably be an overlap of beers between sessions, some breweries are so small that they do not have so many different beers available. But we divide some beers between sessions. So a difference, but not fully 100%.

## Are other beers, wines and ciders also available than from spontaneous and mixed fermentation?

In principle not, but we also understand that it is important to drink something different now and then to fully enjoy all the spontaneously fermented beers, wines and ciders. So we are looking at this.

## Is vegetarian food available?

Of course we take our vegetarian visitors into account!

## Can I leave the festival in the meantime?
Yes, that's possible. Every visitor receives a wristband.

## Can I bring my own beer / wine / cider / food to share?

No. Our participants are dependent on the sale of their products, therefore we cannot allow bottle shares with own brought beer. Moreover, there is plenty of nice drinks and food available for everyone.

## Is there parking space available?

There is sufficient parking space on the Suikerunie site, but we strongly advise everyone to come by public transport.

## How do I get to EM2 by public transport?
The address of EM2 is Suikerlaan 6. Take a look <a href="https://9292.nl/reisadvies/groningen_bushalte-hoofdstation/groningen_suikerlaan-6/vertrek" target="_blank">on the 9292 website</a> for current departure times of, among others, Line 8 from Groningen Central Station.
