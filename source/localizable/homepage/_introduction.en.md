Wild Festival Groningen is an unique beer, wine, cider and food festival in one. During the weekend of November 23, 2019 we bring the worlds of wild beers, natural wines and ciders together. Wild spontaneous fermentation is the central theme, combined with delicious food provided by nature. In addition to the two festival sessions on Saturday, November 23 in EM2, various side events will take place in the days prior to the festival. A festival that you don't want to miss!
