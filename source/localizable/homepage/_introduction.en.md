Wild Festival Groningen 2020 is the second edition of an unique beer, wine, cider and food festival in one.

During the weekend of November 20 we bring the worlds of wild beer, natural wine and cider together. Wild spontaneous fermentation is the central theme, combined with delicious food provided by nature.

In addition to the three (!) festival sessions on Friday, November 20 and Saturday, November 21, various side events will take place in the days around the festival.

**A festival that you don't want to miss!**
