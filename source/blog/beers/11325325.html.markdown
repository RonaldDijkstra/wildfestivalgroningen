description: "An amber colored ale, Black Isle Red Kite is brewed using only the highest quality Maris Otter pale and crystal malts for flavor and body. Challenger hops for bittering with the late addition of Styrian Goldings creates a balance of quenching citrus and malt, and a classic aromatic finish to this refreshing ale. This beer is bright amber with a toasted nut flavor and powerful orange fruit aroma."
