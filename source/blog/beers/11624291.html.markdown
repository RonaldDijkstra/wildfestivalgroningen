description: "Expeccially for the 5 year anniversary of the Beertemple in Amsterdam we were asked to create a awesome westcoast style IIPA. Our answer was the big fat double 5 IPA. With 5 hop varieties and some love the beer got a warm welcome!  However, the owner of the Beertemple was so impressed he decited to have the beer as his new house-beer! Eventually it became the house beer of the Beertemple, â€˜t Arendsnest & Craft&Draft; all located in Amsterdam. The Big Fat Double 5 was given the Gold medal in the Dutch beer challenge for best Imperial IPA of the Netherlands."
