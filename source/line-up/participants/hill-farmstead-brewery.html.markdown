title: "Hill Farmstead Brewery"
description: "Hill Farmstead Brewery is the culmination of many years of travel and insight—of experience and education—of friendships and explorations. The brewery is the revival and continuation of 220 years of Hill heritage and hand crafted history in North Greensboro, Vermont. Its logo is retrieved from a sign that once hung in Aaron Hill's (our great(x3) grandfather) tavern, just up the hill, in the early 1800s."
